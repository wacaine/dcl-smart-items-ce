## Builder Bugginess

Builder is running SDK 6.6.3 (not the latest).  The latest SDK is 6.6.5.  [More on that here](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=72f3d560-d1f4-11eb-9861-ebb8fcfd58d2).   There are a few things Builder does not do right like rotation.  While I try to get workarounds for issues like these please do not think its broke.  When deployed on the latest SDK it works correctly

#### Known issues:

* Face Player + Face Item using Mode: Scene Axis does not work correctly.  Mode: Item Axis works fine in Builder

## Features

### Face Player

The target item will rotate towards the player at a configurable speed for how fast it rotates and stops when facing the player.  The position the item rotates is the position the player was at time of triggering, not where the player moves to afterwards.

### Face Item

The target item will rotate towards the item of interest at a configurable speed for how fast it rotates and stops when facing the item.  The position the item rotates is the position the item was at time of triggering, not where the item of interest moves to afterwards.

### Move to Player

The target item will move towards the player at a configurable speed for how fast it move and stops when arrived at the player.  The position the item moves is the position the player was at time of triggering, not where the player moves to afterwards.

| Parameter                            | Description                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Item                                 | Item to face player |

### Follow Path of Items

The target item will follow a path of defined items. This is like move to item however you list more than one item. It will also not follow the path strictly but more of a curved path AND rotate the object-oriented facing forward along the path. 

| Parameter                            | Description                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Item                                 | Item to be follow the path |
| Move to Item (1-5)                             | Item to move to.  Order picked will be order traversed |
| Return to First                              | If enabled will return to start.  If not will stop at last 'move to item' |
| Face Forward                              | If enabled will rotate the object to be parrellel to the path as it moves |
| # of segements                              | How many point per segment (between move to item(n) and move to item (n+1) |
| Lock X-Axis Rot Movement                              | Will lock X-Axis of rotation while traversing curve |
| Lock Y-Axis Rot Movement                             | Will lock Y-Axis of rotation while traversing curve |
| Lock Z-Axis Rot Movement                             | Will lock Z-Axis of rotation while traversing curve |

### Scene Add/Remove

Action will let you remove/add an object. Not the most elegant way to handle the user experience object/movement but has its uses. One is removed objects do not contribute to scene limitations and boost scene performance.

| Parameter                            | Description                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Item                                 | Item to be add/removed |
| Action                              | Add will add item back to scene.  Remove will remove item from scene |


### Attach To Item

Will attach 1 item to another giving the attached item the position, rotation, scale of the target/host object. This is very useful to move items in one group instead of individually.

| Parameter                            | Description                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Item                                 | Item to be attached |
| Attach To                              | Item to be attached to/make the parent |
| Attach To Origin                              | Attach item's center to the parents center  |
| X Offset                              | Adjust x position. In case attached item and parent do not line up how you like you can try too manually align how you want  |
| Y Offset                              | Adjust y position. In case attached item and parent do not line up how you like you can try too manually align how you want |
| Z Offset                              | Adjust z position. In case attached item and parent do not line up how you like you can try too manually align how you want|

### Detach From Item

Will detach 1 item to another giving the attached item the position, rotation, scale of the target/host object. This is very useful to move items in one group instead of individually. 


| Parameter                            | Description                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Item                                 | Item to be detached |
| Attach To                              | The parent to be detached from |


### Motion Control

Allows a player to pause, stop, resume an action

## Types

### Curve Type

TODO

### Repeat Type

| Parameter                            | Description                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| None                                 | When the action is done. Do not repeat |
| Absolute                               | When the action is done start over from the position/rotation/scale the item was first in before the action started  |
| Relative                               | When the action is done it will loop the same action again from its current position/rotation/scale and apply it again |
| Mirror                               | When the action is done it will loop the same action but in reverse.  It will start from its end position/rotation/scale and return to its start |

### Target Tracking Type

| Parameter                            | Description                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Current Position                                 | Will track the item/player based on current position of that item/player when the action is fired.  It will be  straight path towards this point. |
| End Action Position                               | Will track the item/player based its future/end position if that item/player is in motion.  If not in motion this has the same effect as "Current Position".  It will be  straight path towards this point.  |
| Follow                               | Will track the item/player based on its position at that moment in time.  It will auto correct as the tracked item moves.  This will produce a curved path |

## Multiplayer Support

Listed here are modes/params that I have not thoroughly tested for multi player syncability

* Repeat Types: Absolute, Relative, Mirror.   None should be fine
* Target Tracking Types: Follow.   Current Position/En Action Position should be fine
* Scene Add/Remove - while an item is removed from the scene it will not recieve updates to item syncing
