## Builder Buggyness

Builder is running SDK 6.6.3 (not the latest).  The latest SDK is 6.6.5.  [More on that here](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=72f3d560-d1f4-11eb-9861-ebb8fcfd58d2).   There are a few things Builder does not do right like rotation.  While I try to get workarounds for issues like these please do not think its broke.  When deployed on the latest SDK it works correctly

#### Known issues:

* Face Player + Face Item using Mode: Scene Axis does not work correctly.  Mode:

## Features

### Face Player

The target item will rotate towards the player at a configurable speed for how fast it rotates and stops when facing the player.  The position the item rotates is the position the player was at time of triggering, not where the player moves to afterwards.

### Face Item

The target item will rotate towards the item of interest at a configurable speed for how fast it rotates and stops when facing the item.  The position the item rotates is the position the item was at time of triggering, not where the item of interest moves to afterwards.

### Move to Item

The target item will move towards the target item at a configurable speed for how fast it moves and stops when at the target item.  The position the item moves to is the position the item was at time of triggering, not where the target item moves to afterwards.

### Move to Player

The target item will move towards the player at a configurable speed for how fast it move and stops when arrived at the player.  The position the item moves is the position the player was at time of triggering, not where the player moves to afterwards.

### Follow Path of Items

The target item will follow a path of defined items. This is like move to item however you list more than one item. It will also not follow the path strictly but more of a curved path AND rotate the object-oriented facing forward along the path. 

### Scene Add/Remove

Action will let you remove/add an object. Not the most elegant way to handle the user experience object/movement but has its uses. One is removed objects do not contribute to scene limitations and boost scene performance.

### Attach To Item

Will attach 1 item to another giving the attached item the position, rotation, scale of the target/host object. This is very useful to move items in one group instead of individually.

### Detach From Item

Will detach 1 item to another giving the attached item the position, rotation, scale of the target/host object. This is very useful to move items in one group instead of individually. 

### Motion Control

Allows a player to pause, stop, resume an action
